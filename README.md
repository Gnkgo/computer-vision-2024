# Assignments for the course Computer Vision in 2024

This repository contains the assignments for the Computer Vision course in 2024. Each lab focuses on a different aspect of computer vision, providing hands-on experience with various techniques and algorithms.

## Assignment 1: Feature Extraction
In this lab, you will implement various feature extraction techniques, such as Harris corner detection and descriptor matching. The goal is to extract and match features from images to understand their importance in computer vision tasks.

## Assignment 2: Recognition
This lab focuses on image recognition using the Bag of Words (BoW) model. You will implement the BoW pipeline, including feature extraction, codebook creation, and image classification using nearest neighbor search.

## Assignment 3: Deep Learning
In this lab, you will explore deep learning techniques for image classification. You will implement and train neural networks using popular frameworks to classify images from a given dataset.

## Assignment 4: Image Segmentation
This lab covers image segmentation techniques, including mean-shift segmentation. You will implement these algorithms to segment images into meaningful regions and analyze their performance.

## Assignment 5: Generative Models
In this lab, you will work with generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). The task is to implement and train these models to generate new images based on learned representations.

## Assignment 6: Structure from Motion (SfM) and Model Fitting
This lab focuses on 3D reconstruction from multiple images using Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques. You will implement algorithms to estimate camera poses, triangulate points, and create 3D models from 2D image sequences.

Each lab folder contains the necessary code, data, and instructions to complete the assignments. Refer to the individual lab README files for detailed instructions and requirements.
